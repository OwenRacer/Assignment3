    <p> Some days it's the West African or Muslim American experience he leans into. Other times, its the Black immigrant experience. </p>

<p> Growing up in the Bronx's Councourse neighborhood, only a year after his mom immigranted from Gambia, Husein Yatabarry experienced a "melting pot" of immigrant families. So much so that there was conflict amidst the immigrant communtities, all while Yatabarry regularly walked 162nd Street until he could purchase an international calling card to speak with his four older siblings in Gambia.</p>

<p>Now as the Executive Director of the Muslim Community Network amidst what New York City Mayor Eric Adams calls a "migrant crises," Yatabarry says today's migrant situation reminds him of the African immigration he experinced to the Bronx in the 1980's. </p>

<p> When he first visited The Gambia in 1999, Yatabarry, a city boy, had a culture shock. From flies and outhouses to unsatisfactory food and sparse water and electricity, Yatabarry wanted to go back to the city. He wasn't alone. </p>

<p> Between 2000 and 2019, the United States' Black African immigrant population grew 246 percent to 2.0 million. People of African origin now make up 42 percent of the country’s foreign-born Black population, according to Pew Research.

</script>

    </p>

<p> “Growing up in a West African household, it wasn’t the traditional Black American experience I guess, but in that neighborhood that's what I got to have,”  Yatabarry said. </p>
